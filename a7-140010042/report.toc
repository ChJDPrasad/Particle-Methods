\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1}Plot the L2 error in the approximation with respect to the exact value as a function of the number of points used and the \'h\' value chosen. Use both a cubic spline kernel and the Gaussian Kernels. The L2 norm of a vector y is $|y|$=$(\sum {i}{} y_i)^{0.5}$. Perform the same for the derivative of the function and compare with the exact solution using the formula discussed..\\}{2}
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {2}Finally, pick one of the kernels and add a small amount of noise to the positions of the particles (by adding a small random displacement, uniformly distributed), and see how this affects the accuracy.}{13}
